# Sushi documentation review
## Braindump

**Swaps**
- very lightweight, essentially just follows the user flow to perform certain actions
- missing: 'why am I doing this?', how it works under the hood, consistent voice
- use 'you' instead of 'they'

**Liquidity Pools page**
- more explanation on fees: how they work, why they go back into the pool, how users are making money when swaps are performed in their pool

**Yield Farming**
- too short, expand
- outdated information, 'menu of the week' depricated & replaced w/ Onsen
- Too much about APY, not enough on the story of a person searching for yield

**Lending** 
- too short, expand
- more information about BoringCrypto and how it works

**Limit Orders**
- Order book has a lot of potential, seems like a big move by Sushi. Also begs the question why should I trust your orderbook? A: Unlike other order books, all orders are stored on-chain and can be verified

**Sushinomics the basics**
- It says financial analysis to be completed in Q1 2021: what is this? Might be best to avoid making product or strategic promises in documentation

**Current governance model**
- Remove current from title
- Passed proposals are considered binding... i like that
- leshner and sam in multisig, kinda interesting
- Goal is to create a DAO, again let's focus on what is happening today and save the cool stuff for big announcements
